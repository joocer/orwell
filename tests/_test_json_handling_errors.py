"""
This intentionally breaks the import of orjson even if it is installed on the
system. It does this by removing the path to orjson from the paths it looks at
for imports - this is where a lot of the imports, so before we remove the path
we have to import some that are not used by any of the active code.

This breaks pytest, so we've renamed the file but kept the test so it doesn't
automatically run.
